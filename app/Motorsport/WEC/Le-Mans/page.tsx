                    This year's Le Man's was intersting.
                    From the beggining of this year i was really looking forward to Le Man's particulary because i got to know more about my favourite drivers and teams i want to support.
                </p>

                    As soon as the clock struck 16:00, Drivers begun the 24 hours of le man's.
                    The start was pretty chill. No one spun or got taken out.
                    Porsche #6 starting from 21th place after a disqualification in hyperpole because of the car being underweight Kevin Estre wasted no time.
                    In first hour, #6 was in top 5. Meanwhile after successfull hyperpole from cadillac and other crews of porsche, they wasted no time either.
                    Cadillac unfortunately had no race pace and was overtaken really quickly by porsche #5 and later by three ferraris.
                    Many hours, porsche was in the lead but when night came closer, so did a ferrari. They were flying around de la sarthe circuit in colder conditions.
                    Also Porsche #6 managed to get into fight with ferrari's in top 3.

                    Night time came.
                    Porsche lacked pace and so every other competitors. Apart from ferrari. they didn't.
                    And I must say, the night was calm. Not like last year when was raining for 6 hours.
                    Only thing that happened was some retirements from LMGT3's and crash from LMP2 car.
                    unfortunately, BMW #46 in LMGT3 with Valentino Rossi retired once again from failure.
                    The crew of #46 are cursed or just really unlucky.

                  Sunset over Le Man's 
                  Morning came and so did the race pace of competitors but ferrari's build so big gap it was practically imposibble to beat them.
                  Morning was also calm and only few retirements happened but that's endurance racing.
                </p>

                   We are in last hours of 24 hours of Le Man's.
                   ferrari #83 was in the lead with ex Formula 1 driver and one-time winner - Robert Kubica. We must admit that his pace in that car was overwhelming.
                   Porsche #6 managed to shorten the gap a little but still not enough.
                   Porsche #92 in LMGT3 managed to build the gap over the 1 minute which was really impresive and another example of tÂ´domination of manthey racing brand.
                   But in the finish line, the gap was only 33 seconds after a final pitstops.
                   In LMP2 class, There was one and only Inter Europol Competition with gap nearly 2 minutes. Polish squad really took this Le Man's personally.
                   Another sooner end met a United Autosports mclaren 720s with crew ##95 made only 80 laps and crew #59 314 laps but both cars retired.
                   Also both BMW in hypercar class were pushed to garage which is always a bad sign. they were able to complete Le Man's but with gaps on the leading cars with #20 12 laps and #15 26 laps.

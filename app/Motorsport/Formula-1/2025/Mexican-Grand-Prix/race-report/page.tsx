                    The race started wild.
                    We had 4 cars side by side down into turn 1.
                    But, ironically, only 1 managed to stay on track.
                    A great start by LN4 practically won him his 10th win of his carrer.
                    But on the other side of garage, we had another battle.
                    OP81 started from P7 but was demoted to P9 after T1.
                    However Piastri kept his cool and finished in P5. 
                    In Mexico, we finally had a full action with 6 drivers.
                    In T1, we saw hard racing between reign champions MV1 and LH44 and also they collided a little.
                    In T3, another 4 fight begun with LH44 cutting corners and eventually stewards awarded him 10 second time penalty, MV1 went wide and all of it used Oliver Bearman on Haas who managed to overtake MV1 for P3.
                    He stayed in P3 until a first round of pitstops. MV1 pace on hards was briliant and Haas is no match for MV1.
                    but still a unbelieveble result for young briton in Haas.
                    After what looked a potential race win for ferrari's, It was only a P2 and P8.
                    Leclerc drove well, even keeping up to LN4 but eventually dropped out.
                    Hamilton ater 10 second was just slow and couldn't keep up with rest of the pack.
                    Mercedes, with a little of drama between GR63 and his engineer, only in P6 and P7.
                    But LN4 won Mexican grand prix by 30 seconds, biggest margin in season so far.
                    But a little bittersweat win for LN4 because his celebrations must have been soured by booing of mexican fans in dissapproving of team choice in Monza.

                    FIA.
                    I just have no words for this clown association.<br/>
                    1st - couldn't managed to rightfully penalize T1.<br/>
                    2nd - they let MARSHALLS RUNNING IN T1 WITH CAR DRIVING OVER 130km/h into T1.
                    Just how dump or short-brained you must be to not fully check if all cars are out of range and even if you make a fatal mistake which fortunately wasn't today, you wont even accept your fault but YOU BLAME A DRIVER FOR NOT MAKING A EFFORT TO DODGE THOSE MARSHALLS!
                    <br/>
                    Really FIA is just, like Guenther Steiner would say, a bunch of wankers.

                    But overall a exiting race which isn't a tradition in Mexico but it was nice to see a change.

                    Next stop: Sao Paulo, Brasil.

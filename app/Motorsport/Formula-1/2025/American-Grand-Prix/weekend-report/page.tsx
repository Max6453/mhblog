                    Friday started really positive from mclaren's.
                    FP1 was won by LN4 and in sprint qualifying, they looked really good too.
                    But a Verstappen's exeptional drive overshadowed them.
                    And Ferrari were in troubles from the first minute of the weekend.
                    Mercedes, on the other hand, they were in the field of no one.
                </p>

                    Sprint was full of action.
                    First corner in Austin always bring exitment.
                    In sprint, we saw already 3 retirements in first lap.
                    After a chains of events, both Mclarens DNF'd in first lap along with Fernando Alonso.
                    MV1 took his sprint victory with GR63 finishing in P2 and CS55 made it to P3 in sprint.
                    I personally didn't watch qualifying but after I saw report, I can only say that MV1 smoked whole competition.
                    Onto the race.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-4xl m-5 lg:pl-75 pt-5">Sunday</h3>

                    Now, the start was safer this time.
                    MV1 stayed in P1 but CL16 after a aggresive start on softs overtook LN4 for P2.
                    His stint on softs was surprising with track temperature rising up to 40 degrees.
                    Cooling his tyres was essential for potential win or at worst P2.
                    Meanwhile OP81 overtook GR63 for P5. 
                    After first pitstops, situation was calm.
                    Until LN4 came closer to CL16. 
                    After a long battles at the start of the race, where LN4 had troubles to overtake CL16 ferrari, He finally managed to overtake him on track and finish in P2.
                    Ferrari's ended in P3 and P4 and OP81 in P5.
                    But Max Verstappen won 2025 American grand prix and he closed the gap to 40 points.

                    This race once again proved why Mclaren didn't deserved to win a constructors.
                    Yes they design team made a fantasatic job. How they managed to rebuild the car in 2 years is something not many teams can be proud of.
                    However, their strategy and trackside team needs a rebuild.
                    So many mistakes from either drivers or whole team is unbearable to watch from champions.
                    And I don't want to start about their pitstops.
                    There isn't a race weekend where either Norris or Piastri have a slow stop.
                    And these mistakes will ultimately cost them a driver championship.

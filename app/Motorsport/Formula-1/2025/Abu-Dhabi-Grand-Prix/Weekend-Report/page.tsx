                    Before we start, I need to apologise to you for my absence because I have zero time and motivation right now to wrtie articles.
                    Right now I have to many things to take care of so excuse my inactivity and lets dive into last race of the race.

                    From the start, we knew that Mclaren will be once again strong. This type of track suits their car.
                    But we shouldn't write off Max Verstappen and his red bull.
                    Two practices were won by LN4 and 3rd won GR63.
                    Qualifying was tense because for the past years, the one who took pole usually won the race.
                    MV1 won the qualifying with LN4 and OP81 behind him.

                    Start alone was calm with top three unchanged but Leclerc's ferrari was really fast. He was flying around yas marina the whole race.
                    In T8,  OP81 overtook LN4 for 2nd place. Meanwhile MV1 already was over 1 second ahead.
                    Now the long game begins.
                    LN4 started the race calmly but also slowly. He was multiple times threathened by CL16 but he defended it well.
                    MV1 pace was unmatched by OP81.
                    The race itself was boring with few overtakes into T5 or T8.
                    After 1st pitstops, LN4 found himself at 7th place. At this place his championship would be over.
                    With fresher tyres, he climbed place after place.
                    Yuki Tsunoda was running at P4. he tryed to help his teammate by defending LN4 as much as he could but he pushed him off at long straight after T4.
                    Now this situation is tricky because while Tsunoda pushed him off track, LN4 overtook him off track which obviously isn't legal.
                    At the end of the day, Tsunoda got 5 second penalty for pushing another driver off track.
                    LN4 wasn't penalised.
                    But Leclerc wasn't done. he tryed to catch up LN4 but he didn't.

                    While MV1 celebrates P1 at 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Lando Norris can celebrate too as he becomes the newest formula 1 world driver's champion.
                    Unbelievable season for LN4 but also for OP81 and MV1. 
                    As I write this article, the best drivers already recieved their awards at FIA awards in Uzbekistan.

                    Incredible season this was with even more, for me as mclaren and LN4 fan, incredible season finale in Abu Dhabi.
                    Next year, we will welcome on the grid Cadillac, Sauber will transfer to Audi and we also get a new cars.

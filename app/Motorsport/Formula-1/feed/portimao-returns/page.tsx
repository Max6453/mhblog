            lowerText="It's expected that portimao will take place of Zandvoort which will depart from formula 1 calendar at the end of 2026 season.
            But Portimao offers better racing as there are more opportunities for overtakes such as T3, T5, T10, 2 long straights(mind you that DRS won't be used in 2026 regulations.).
            This track is mix of Spa or COTA by it's profile. It has long straight and one shorther straight with great ability of overtaking and overall flow of the track.
            I'm looking forward racing in Portimao."

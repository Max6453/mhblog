            mainText="The game is set in a dark fantasy version of the Belle Époque (a period inspired by late 19th-century France).
            You play as a group of volunteers on a mission to kill The Paintress, a mysterious being who wakes up once a year to paint a number on a giant rock.
            Anyone who is that age or older instantly vanishes—a terrifying event the people call the 'Gommage.'
            The world, known as the Continent, is huge and colorful.
            It’s clear the developers put a lot of heart into it.
            The levels aren’t just corridors; they are open and full of hidden spots to find if you’re willing to wander off the main path."
            middleText="Technically, the game is solid.
            It’s well-optimized and I ran into almost zero crashes, which is rare these days.
            The combat is turn-based, which might feel a bit 'old school' if you haven't played something like Final Fantasy in a while.
            Personally, I grew to love it because it makes the game feel unique compared to everything else on the market.
            On the other hand multiple things got me annoyed.
            The timing for parrying and blocking is very tight. I’ve never struggled more with defensive moves in a game than I did here.
            It takes a lot of practice to get the rhythm down, and it can be a bit frustrating at first.

            lowerText="Expedition 33 turned out to be a fun, surprising experience that changed my mind about its 'Game of the Year' status.
            It’s a polished, beautiful game that really rewards the player for sticking with it.

            But after finishing Act I, I was completely hooked. Now, I finally understand why it’s being called Game of the Year."

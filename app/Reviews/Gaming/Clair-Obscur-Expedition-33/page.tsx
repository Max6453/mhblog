            mainText="Expedition 33 is RPG game with vast and colorfull world known as the continent.
            Story is set in dark fantasy Belle Époque period.
            You play as volunteers in expedition team whose mission is to eliminate the paintress.
            An entity which once an year draws age number on gigantic rock.
            Those whose age is the same or older than on the rock dissapears.
            People of Lumière call this event a 'Gommage'.
            The goal of these expeditions is to eliminate the paintress and stop the gommage.
            But will you succeed?"
            middleText="I was really sceptical when I played Expedition 33.
            I felt that it was overhyped and overated. But atfer Act I, I couldn't stop playing.
            I really liked the world. Developers poured their heart into the world.
            Fully accessible levels outside of main storyline but also many hidden locations.
            From mechanical side, I can't say a bad word. The game was optimized nearly 0 crashes and fun mechanics.
            On the other hand, I couldn't get used to ancient combat system.
            Last time I played with turn system was in Final Fantasy series.
            But i like this system. It makes a game more unique.
            What i don't like is small parry or blog windows.
            Never had more troubles parrying or blocking enemies attack than in this game.
